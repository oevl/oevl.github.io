title: Windows 7 downgrade at work
type: text
---
At work I had to downgrade three computers from Windows 10 to Windows 7, one desktop and two laptops. The desktop needed a new drive so I installed a SSD drive, and the process took almost two days, including processing the previous updates and installing Office 365 thru our subscription.

But the two laptops, a couple of Acer One D255E's with just 1GB of RAM have been giving me a hard time during the updating process, they are too slow and under powered (Atom CPUs) and I have been facing many errors because of that.
